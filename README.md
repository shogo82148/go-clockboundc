## Run the example

### Prerequisites

[chronyd](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/) must be running in order to run ClockBoundD.

### Install Rust and Cargo

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) are required for building ClockBoundD.
On Linux or another UNIX-like OS, run the following in your terminal.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

See [Installation section on The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) for more detail.

### Install GCC

You may need to also install gcc:

```
sudo yum install gcc
```

### Install ClockBoundD

Run `cargo install` and start ClockBoundD:

```
cargo install clock-bound-d
$HOME/.cargo/bin/clockboundd
```

If you want to daemonize ClockBoundD, see [Systemd configuration](https://github.com/aws/clock-bound/blob/main/clock-bound-d/README.md#systemd-configuration).

### Run

Now, you can run the example using `go run` command.

```
go run ./cmd/go-clockboundc-now
```

You will get the current system clock with a clock error bound.
